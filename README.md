Welcome to the Plant Game Project.
This Program is going to be created as an Assessment for the Technical Project at the ISEN Yncrea University.
The App should give a notification to all users (once a day/week) to find a specific plant. 
The user tries to find it then and makes pictures of plants he thinks are the right one. 
If the picture is of the wrong one he is told to continue searching. 
If the user finds the requested plant, he/she can post it on Instagram and gets one level up.
